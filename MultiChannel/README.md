# MultiChannel
Multi-channel LSTM-CNN model for Vietnamese sentiment analysis

This is implementation for the paper "Multi-channel LSTM-CNN model for Vietnamese sentiment analysis" [[link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321259272_Multi-channel_LSTM-CNN_model_for_Vietnamese_sentiment_analysis)].

We provide a sentiment analysis dataset: VS. The dataset include two version: tokenized and without tokenized.

To run this code: 
1. Please specify a data path in preprocessing.py and load_data.py.
2. Run "python preprocessing.py" and then "python cnn_lstm.py"


Requirement:
1. Keras
2. Tensorflow
